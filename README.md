You were looking for a bot, and then you found a bot.

Uses the [badwords list](https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter/blob/master/lib/badwords.json) from [Darius Kazemi's `wordfilter` library](https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter/). I welcome any reports of racist, sexist, ablist, transphobic, etc. language as GitHub issues or over twitter.
